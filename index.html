                    <p>Hi, my name is Ivy Yuan. I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Davidson College. From the experience in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), I am deeply inspired by the intersection of technology and human experience. My coursework in HCI has ignited a passion for product design, transforming my perspective from purely building functional codes to crafting meaningful, user-centered solutions. I am now driven to design technology that truly resonates with people by prioritizing human feedback at every stage.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Over the four design sprints of this course, I realized that product design is not just about producing something that are entirely novel, but much more about 
                          adapting a mindset of understanding people, solving problems, iterating with ideas, and shaping existing technology around real human needs. 
                          Whether I was redesigning a local furniture store’s website, visualizing Spotify user data, constructing a VR alien-dog-searching game, or building 
                          a full physical kiosk prototype for the furniture store, that kind of mindset was gradually developed as the backbone of my personal design practice. These six principles reflect how 
                          I now approach design and how I would translate these skills into completely new contexts.
                        </p>

                  <div class="step-content">
                      <h3>Design Begins With Real People, Not With Technology</h3>
                      <p>One of the most transformative lessons from this course was that design begins long before prototyping. Instead of simply trying to come up with something that I personally consider a good practice, 
                        design should start with understanding the people who will use the product, who are the target users. 
                      </p>

                      <div class="step-image">

                      </div>
                      <p>
          
                        In Design Sprint 1, crafting personas for Knotty & Board fundamentally shifted our decisions: imagining Liam, a busy professional shopping on the go, or Mary, an Airbnb 
                        host with low tech-confidence, helped us simplify navigation flows and build clearer signifiers. We also decided that one of our major improvements was to emphasize the availability of receiving help 
                        from staff, and we wanted to focus on improving design services page as these two people might be interested in procuring the service. Even though these personas were hypothetical, the process taught me the 
                        value of grounding design in empathy rather than my self-assumption of what users should value.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This realization was also revealed in later sprints. When visualizing Spotify data, we imagined two separate audiences—analysts seeking clarity and executives seeking persuasion—and 
                        realized those needs require different forms of visualization. In the VR sprint, recognizing VR novices shaped decisions like adding barking cues to help players find 
                        the alien dog without frustration. In the kiosk sprint, thinking about in-store shoppers frustrated with limited time pushed us to provide more convenient search methods of furnitures.

                        <h3>Iteration Is the Process—Never the Final Step</h3>
                        <p>Each sprint reminded me that design is iterative because people are unpredictable and our design was never perfect enough to cover all kinds of need. The workflow from sketches to paper prototype, to Figma prototype, then to 
                          to physical prototype, and eventually to in-class demo and feedback helps us to refine our ideas significantly.</p>
                        <p>
                          In Design Sprint 1, we believed our laptop layout was clean until usability testing revealed confusion around the cart widget and unclear icons. Those discoveries could only emerge when someone outside our group interacted with the 
                          design. In Design Sprint 2, we learned that our scatterplot was visually overwhelming only after classmates struggled to read it. What we thought was “thorough” turned out to be impenetrable. And in the kiosk sprint, the login-code 
                          feature made perfect sense to us as designers but confused every single tester—forcing us to remove it altogether.

                          Iteration also produced new inspiration we never planned for. The printed barcode pieces idea for easier item scanning emerged late, influenced by classroom feedback. The idea for a reticle in our VR game appeared only after classmates described difficulty 
                          aligning their vision with the dog. Iteration wasn’t just polishing—it became a space for creative breakthroughs.

                        <p>Alongside iteration, I learned to think in versions—Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0—each one expanding the previous only after the core experience functioned.</p>

                        <p>
                          Our VR alien-dog game followed an explicit version pipeline:

                          * V1.0: A basic solar system and a static dog
                          * V2.0: Orbiting planets and vertical movement
                          * V3.0: Ambient music and proximity-based barking

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each layer unlocked the next. Without stable movement, audio cues would have been irrelevant. Without a recognizable environment, the narrative would fall flat.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The same layered structure emerged in the kiosk project. We started with the smallest possible viable flow—home → browse → add to cart → checkout—before introducing 
                          extras like saved carts, item scanning, a service-booking page, and a physical hardware prototype.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Versioning helped me resist the temptation to build “everything, all at once.” Instead, it pushed us to build the right things in the right order—a principle 
                          that scales to any complex system.

                        <h3>Prototyping Across Dimensions and Media</h3>
                        <p>A major theme across the semester was that changing the modality of a design forces us to rethink interaction itself. Designing a smartwatch interface is not 
                          just shrinking down a laptop version; designing VR is not just adding depth; building a physical kiosk is not just mounting a website on a screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each modality taught me something new:

                            * Smartwatch (Sprint 1): I learned that minimalism is not optional but required. Every pixel must justify its existence.
                            * Large displays + touch interaction: Users expect interactivity, spatial awareness, and visible affordances.
                            * Data visualization dashboards (Sprint 2): Modalities of persuasion vs. analysis demand different visual grammars.
                            * VR (Sprint 3): Spatial design replaces traditional UI, and movement becomes a primary interface.
                            * Physical kiosk (Sprint 4): Hardware constraints become part of the design—height, reachability, scanning gestures, and spatial orientation all affect usability.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Designing across modalities made me more flexible. It taught me that “interaction” is not a singular concept but a contextual one shaped by physical, cognitive, and 
                          technological constraints.

                      <h3>Constraints Spark Creativity</h3>
                      <p>Across all four design sprints, one of the most surprising lessons I learned is that constraints—whether technical, spatial, or conceptual—often lead to more 
                        thoughtful and creative outcomes than limitless freedom. What initially felt like obstacles consistently became catalysts for better design decisions.

                      </div>
                      <p>In the VR sprint, our lack of experience with Unity pushed us toward A-Frame, a tool with fewer features but a gentler learning curve. Instead of being a 
                        setback, this constraint allowed us to focus on core interactions—movement, spatial cues, simple models—rather than losing time chasing highly complex graphics. 
                        The dog’s 2D sprite, which emerged from our inability to generate a suitable 3D model, ultimately added a humorous charm that strengthened the personality of the experience.

                      <p>
                        The kiosk sprint confronted us with physical constraints—screen size, hardware limitations, cost restrictions, and user height reachability. These 
                        limitations shaped our choices more than any stylistic preference. We learned that adding “everything we wanted” would create confusion, while designing 
                        within constraints resulted in a cleaner, more purposeful interface.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Working with constraints taught me that design is not about imagining infinite possibilities; it is about making the right decisions within finite boundaries. 
                        Constraints focus the mind, clarify priorities, and reveal what truly matters to the user. In future projects—especially in domains like brain-computer 
                        interfaces, where constraints are profound—I would welcome limitations as a core part of the creative process rather than an external obstacle.

                    </div>
                    <p>Across sprints, the richest insights came from actual human behavior: testers ignoring buttons we thought were obvious, misunderstanding labels we 
                      thought were intuitive, or describing emotional reactions we never anticipated. Sometimes the biggest challenges were not technical but human: confusion, 
                      frustration, hesitation, or assumptions shaped by past experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Human feedback radically reoriented our work:

                      * In the data visualization sprint, classmates showed us how misleading synthetic data can be—teaching us to treat datasets with skepticism.
                      * In the VR sprint, people struggled with the coordinate system, prompting us to rethink how spatial information is conveyed.
                      * In the kiosk sprint, nearly everyone interpreted the “login code” screen differently, revealing how prior expectations shape interface comprehension.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Humans introduced unpredictability, but that unpredictability is precisely why design exists. Technology alone cannot dictate meaning; people complete 
                      the interface through their actions, assumptions, and interpretations.

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                  <p>Across these sprints, I learned that good design is less about mastery of tools and more about cultivating a 
                    process: listening deeply, iterating deliberately, layering features in manageable versions, adapting across 
                    modalities, and grounding every decision in human behavior. These principles will remain relevant no matter 
                    how technology evolves—whether I am designing for VR, kiosks, traditional screens, or brain-computer interfaces 
                    in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most importantly, I learned that design is not linear. It is cyclical, nonlinear, and collaborative. It moves 
                    between imagining, building, testing, failing, refining, and reimagining. And within that cycle lies the creativity 
                    that defines human-centered design.
